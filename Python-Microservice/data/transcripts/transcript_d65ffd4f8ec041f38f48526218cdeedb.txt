<Person1> "Welcome to Rela A-I! Your daily dose of trending news.  Today, we're tackling a burning question for all those Anglophiles out there: Can Americans drive in England with a US license?" 
</Person1><Person2> "Oh, this is important!  I've always dreamt of cruising through the Cotswolds in a, you know, classic Mini Cooper!"
</Person2><Person1> "Hold your horses!  It's not quite as simple as hopping across the pond and zooming off." 
</Person1><Person2> "Wait, really? I thought it was just like, show your license, grab your keys, and go!"
</Person2><Person1> "Not quite! This article from July 15th, 2025, by Olivia Richman, sets us straight.  Good news first: if you have a valid US license, you're good to drive in England for a whole year after you arrive!" 
</Person1><Person2> "A whole year? Sweet! Road trip time!"
</Person2><Person1> "Whoa, hold on. There are some rules.  Small vehicles only â€“ cars and motorcycles. No double-decker buses for you!" 
</Person1><Person2> "Dang it! My dreams of being a London bus driver are crushed." 
</Person2><Person1> "But think of the Mini Cooper!  And you need a current, non-expired license. If it's in English, you're golden. If not, you'll need an international driving permit." 
</Person1><Person2> "Got it. So, license, passport, return ticket, and proof of address.  Sounds like prepping for a spy mission!"
</Person2><Person1> "Ha! Sort of. Now, what if you want to ship your own car over?"
</Person1><Person2> "Ship my car?  Isn't that, like, crazy expensive?"
</Person2><Person1> "Maybe, but it's possible!  And you can drive it for up to six months, in chunks or all at once, within a year. No need to register it or change the plates. Just keep your US registration and insurance." 
</Person1><Person2> "That's pretty cool, actually. Imagine rolling through London in your own, uh... beat-up Honda Civic."
</Person2><Person1> "Hey, no judgement! Just make sure your insurance covers you in England.  And be ready to show proof you're a visitor if the police stop you." 
</Person1><Person2> "Right.  Don't want to end up in a British jail because of expired insurance." 
</Person2><Person1> "Exactly. So, to recap, driving in England with a US license is doable, but know the rules! And remember, they drive on the left!" 
</Person1><Person2> "Don't remind me!  I'll probably end up on the wrong side of the road anyway." 
</Person2><Person1> "Well, that's all the time we have for today folks! Thanks for tuning into Rela A-I.  Drive safe, and we'll catch you next time!" </Person1>
