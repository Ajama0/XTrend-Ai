<Person1> "Welcome to Rela A-I - Your daily dose of trending news.  Have you heard about this Kate Bush Day thing?  It's absolutely bonkers!" It's like, a thousand people in red dresses, all doing the 'Wuthering Heights' dance. Imagine!
</Person1><Person2> A thousand Kates?   Sounds like my kind of nightmare, actually. But, uh, tell me more.  Where does this happen? On the moors?
</Person2><Person1> Not quite the moors, my friend. This particular madness unfolds on a concrete stage in Folkestone, Kent. Right on the Harbour Arm! It's a global phenomenon apparently, with events in, like, everywhere from Australia to Israel! 
</Person1><Person2> Global?  Wow. So, it’s not just a British thing?  Although, honestly, it sounds peak British eccentricity to me. A thousand people dressed as Kate Bush…  Why? Just… why?
</Person2><Person1> The article's author, Helen Coffey, puts it best: "Why not?"   It's pure, unadulterated joy.   Coffey described her first time:  two hours of sleep, raging hangover, still had a blast!    Sounds familiar!
</Person1><Person2>  Uh huh.  I bet.  So, is it just random flailing, or is there, like, actual choreography? 
</Person2><Person1> Oh, there's choreography!  And "Head Kates!"   They stand on podiums and lead the masses in this beautiful, bonkers dance.  Coffey became a Head Kate! "It's quite possibly the closest I’ll ever come to feeling like a celebrity," she wrote! Leading hundreds of people in red dresses?   Iconic.
</Person1><Person2>   You know, I'm starting to see the appeal.  It sounds ridiculous, sure, but also...kind of amazing? 
</Person2><Person1> Exactly!  It’s a collective experience.   Coffey talked about the energy, the feeling of being part of something bigger. And the organizer, Toby Cotton, said it's all about doing something fun together.  That's a powerful thing.    Plus, the image of a thousand people all yelling, "It's ME, I’m Cathy!"   Priceless!
</Person1><Person2>  Alright, alright, you've convinced me. I'm adding "Become a Head Kate" to my bucket list.  Right after "Learn the Wuthering Heights dance," of course. 
</Person2><Person1> That's the spirit! Thanks for tuning in to Rela A-I everyone, and we'll catch you next time for more trending news!  Bye for now!</Person1>
