<Person1> "Welcome to Rela A-I  - Your daily dose of trending news! Tonight, we're diving headfirst into the Premier League Summer Series clash between Man U and Bournemouth!  Get ready for some fireworks at Soldier Field in Chicago!"
</Person1><Person2> "Fireworks? More like a damp squib if it's anything like some of their recent meetings. Remember that 1-1 draw last season?   Thrilling stuff." 
</Person2><Person1> "Hey now,  this is preseason! Anything can happen! And remember, Man U edged out West Ham 2-1, thanks to a Bruno Fernandes brace! The man is on fire, even in July!"
</Person1><Person2> "Yeah, but Bournemouth crushed Everton 3-0.  Billing, Ouattara, and Adu-Adjei all found the net. They looked pretty sharp, even without some key defenders." 
</Person2><Person1> "True.  Bournemouth's defense is a bit of a patchwork right now, but they've got some interesting new additions. Petrović in goal and Truffert at left-back are ones to watch. I'm curious to see how they'll handle Man U's attack though, especially if  Højlund gets some minutes!"
</Person1><Person2> " Oh yeah, because that worked so well for them last time.  Let's not forget, Bournemouth are unbeaten in their last four against Man U! They almost snatched a win last season if it wasn't for that late equalizer." 
</Person2><Person1>  "I see, interesting. I mean, Bournemouth's new-look defense held up well against Everton.  I think Iraola has them playing some cohesive football.  But Man U has the star power. Fernandes, Mount...they could turn it on at any moment, you know?"
</Person1><Person2> " 'Star power'. Uh-huh. Remind me again how they did last season? Let's be real, their midfield is still figuring things out.  Bournemouth could exploit that weakness, especially with Billing pulling the strings." 
</Person2><Person1> "That’s an interesting take.  You really think Bournemouth can pull off the upset?"
</Person1><Person2> "I'm just sayin', don't count them out.  I think James Cormack from Sports Illustrated is spot on.  2-1 Bournemouth. Bet the house on it. " 
</Person2><Person1> "Woah there!   I don't know about betting the house, but it definitely has the potential to be a close one! Especially with both teams eager to win this preseason tournament." 
</Person1><Person2> "Preseason or not, bragging rights are on the line!"
</Person2><Person1> "Gotta love that competitive spirit.  Well, folks, that's all the time we have for today's preview! Tune in tomorrow for the post-match analysis. This is Rela A-I, signing off!" </Person1>
