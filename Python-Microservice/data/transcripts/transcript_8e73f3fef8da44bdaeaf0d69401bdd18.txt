<Person1>Welcome to XTrends - Trendy podcasts on demand.  So, uh, this Freitag messenger bag, huh? Made from trash.  Pretty wild concept.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, remember messenger bags? Total '90s, right?  Everyone had one.  Especially… especially those bike messengers.</Person2>
<Person1>Oh, totally.  Like, weaving through traffic, all that.  This article, it's like, taking me back. This new Freitag bag, the, uh… F685 Henry… it’s like a blast from the past, but… but with a sustainable twist.</Person1>
<Person2>Right?  Old seatbelts, truck tarps… even plastic bottles.  It’s like… it’s like they raided a junkyard, but in a good way.    A very stylish junkyard.  A curated junkyard, perhaps?</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah!   Curated trash.  Love it!  And apparently, they're, like, super durable. The article mentions one lasting 20 years!  Twenty years! That's… that's incredible.</Person1>
<Person2>Seriously.  Built to last.  Which, you know, kind of ironic, given the whole "made from trash" thing. But, hey, I'm all for it.  Reduce, reuse, recycle, right?</Person2>
<Person1>Exactly!  And it’s not just, you know, a gimmick.  This reviewer, Thomas Ricker, he seems…  he seems genuinely impressed. Uses it as his daily carryall. To the gym, the train… everywhere!</Person1>
<Person2>Oh yeah?  So it's, like, practical, too? Not just, like, a fashion statement?</Person2>
<Person1>Apparently!  Holds a lot, too.  Expands from 13 liters to, like, 20 liters.  Big enough for all your… all your stuff.  Though… he does mention a… a downside.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh?  What's that?</Person2>
<Person1>Velcro.  Lots and lots of velcro.  Like, an aggressive amount of velcro.  He wasn’t a fan of the… the sound, apparently.</Person1>
<Person2>The… the rip?  Yeah, that can be… jarring.  Especially in a quiet place.</Person2>
<Person1>Exactly.  But hey, maybe that's part of the charm?  You know, that rugged, industrial… kind of aesthetic.</Person1>
<Person2>True.  It’s definitely… a statement piece.  Not for the faint of heart.  Or… faint of ear, I guess.  Three hundred and thirty bucks, though.  That’s… that’s a bit steep for a bag made of, you know… trash. Even curated trash.</Person2>
<Person1>So, $330 for curated trash, huh?  It's a lot. But this article, it’s got me thinking. This whole '90s messenger bag vibe… it's back!</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, totally! Remember those bike messengers?  Zipping through traffic…  a blur of chrome and… and canvas. Those bags were like, their… their office, right?</Person2>
<Person1>Totally.  And this Freitag bag, the F685 Henry, it’s tapping into that nostalgia, but with a, uh… a sustainable twist.  Old seatbelts, truck tarps… even plastic bottles.</Person1>
<Person2>It's like… upcycling on steroids!   I love that they're all unique, too.  No two are the same. It's like… a fingerprint. But for your bag.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah!  That’s cool.  And this reviewer, Thomas Ricker, he’s been using it for weeks.  To the gym, on the train… everywhere!  Says it’s incredibly durable.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh, so it's like, practical?  Not just a fashion statement?</Person2>
<Person1>Apparently!  He even mentions owning one for, like, 20 years!  Twenty years!  That's… that's insane.  Built to last, huh?</Person1>
<Person2>Seriously.  Which, you know, kinda ironic, given it's made from… you know… discarded stuff. It’s like giving trash a second life. A very stylish second life.  But $330?  Oof. That's… pricey.</Person2>
<Person1>Okay, so $330, right?  For a bag made of… well, you know…  repurposed… stuff.  It's a lot. But a three-year warranty?  That's… something.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, that does soften the blow a little. Especially if it's as durable as they say.  This reviewer, whatshisname… Thomas…</Person2>
<Person1>Ricker, yeah. He used it as his, like, everyday bag.  Gym, train, work… the whole nine yards.</Person1>
<Person2>And? How’d it hold up?</Person2>
<Person1>Seemed to do the job.  Expandable, too.  Thirteen liters to twenty.  So, you know, pretty versatile.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh, that's nice.  Practical and stylish.  Well, arguably stylish.    Depends on your taste, I suppose.</Person2>
<Person1>Right.    But, uh… there's a catch.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh?  Let me guess. The price tag?</Person2>
<Person1>Well, that, yes. But also… the velcro.  So. Much. Velcro.</Person1>
<Person2>Velcro?  What, like… all over the bag?</Person2>
<Person1>Everywhere, apparently.  And, uh… loud.  Like, really loud.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh no.  Like… ripping-open-a-bag-of-chips-in-a-library loud?</Person2>
<Person1>Worse, apparently.  He talks about getting kicked out of a theater.    Imagine.</Person1>
<Person2>Yikes.  That’s… committed to the whole industrial aesthetic.  Maybe a little too committed.  But hey, at least it's weatherproof, right?  Truck tarps and all that.</Person2>
<Person1>Okay, but aside from the… uh… sonic assault of the velcro, what else have we got?  Anything… redeeming?</Person1>
<Person2>Well, this Ricker guy seems to love the… the practicality of it.  He goes on and on about how easy it is to swing it around, you know…  access those outer pockets.</Person2>
<Person1>Oh?  Like, uh… quick access to your phone and… and whatnot?</Person1>
<Person2>Exactly!  He even mentions a key lanyard.  Which, you know…  pretty handy.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, I guess.  But swinging it around? Sounds like a recipe for disaster.  Especially with all that… velcro.</Person1>
<Person2>True.  Imagine swinging that thing around in a crowded train.  It’d be like a… a one-man velcro orchestra.</Person2>
<Person1>Seriously!  But, okay, so… pockets.  What kind of pockets are we talking about?</Person1>
<Person2>Well, two outer pockets, apparently. One zippered, one not.  And a side zipper pocket for your phone or wallet. So… pretty standard messenger bag stuff.</Person2>
<Person1>Standard, but… functional, I suppose.  Anything… unusual?  Aside from, you know, the material and the…  the deafening velcro?</Person1>
<Person2>Hmm…  He mentions a three-point strap.  For, like, extra security. Keeping it close to your body.</Person2>
<Person1>Oh, right.  Like those bike messengers.  Weaving through traffic and all that.</Person1>
<Person2>Exactly.  Though, he admits it's not really necessary in Amsterdam, with their, uh… protected bike lanes.  But, hey, extra security never hurts, right?</Person2>
<Person1>Okay, so, uh… reflectors made from recycled truck markings.  That's… interesting.  Practical, too, I guess.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, especially for, like, night cycling.  Safety first, right?  And it fits with the whole… industrial vibe.</Person2>
<Person1>Totally.  So, uh… what about the inside?  Anything… special?</Person1>
<Person2>Well, apparently, it's… pretty basic.  Like, just a big open space.  You'd probably want some, uh… organizer pouches.  For your camera gear, and… whatnot.</Person2>
<Person1>Oh, so not, like… compartments and… and dividers and… stuff?</Person1>
<Person2>Nope.  Just one big… void.   Which, you know, could be good or bad. Depends on how you… organize your stuff.</Person2>
<Person1>Right.  And the laptop sleeve?  Any good?</Person1>
<Person2>Eh… it's there.  A little padding, but… not a ton.  Definitely wouldn't want to, like, toss the bag around.  Gotta treat it with… respect.</Person2>
<Person1>So, uh… gentle placement only?   Got it.</Person1>
<Person2>Exactly.  But, hey, lots of webbing!  For attaching… all your… all your things.</Person2>
<Person1>Oh? Like… carabiners and… and straps and…?</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah!  Even, like, a U-lock.  Or a yoga mat.  Apparently.</Person2>
<Person1>A yoga mat?    Okay, that's… versatile.</Person1>
<Person2>Right?  From, like, bike messenger to… yogi.  Just like that.  But, uh… all those straps? They can get a little… unruly.  Fortunately, there's a, uh… a sleeve.  To tuck them away.  For a cleaner… look.</Person2>
<Person1>Oh, that's good.  So, uh… any other… downsides?  Besides the, you know… cavernous main compartment and the… delicate laptop sleeve?</Person1>
<Person2>Well… the big one is the… stiffness.  And the weight.  That recycled PET bottle fabric?  It’s… tough.  Like, really tough.  But also… kind of… rigid.  And heavy.</Person2>
<Person1>Okay, so, this… this weight issue.  3.26 pounds?  That's…  that's hefty for a messenger bag, right?</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, that's…  that's a dense bag.  Like carrying around a small… bowling ball or something.  But, I mean, if it's built to last, maybe that's the trade-off?</Person2>
<Person1>Right?  Like, uh…  he mentions it loosening up with use.  So maybe it's just…  initially stiff?  Like… breaking in a new pair of shoes?</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, yeah, I get that. My, uh… my old Freitag, it's like…  buttery soft now.  Took years, but…  worth it.</Person2>
<Person1>So, this… PET bottle fabric.  It's tough, but… rigid.  Interesting.  And, uh…  how does it compare to, like… a regular messenger bag material?</Person1>
<Person2>Well, it's definitely…  sturdier.  More…  protective, I guess.  Like, you wouldn't want to…  drop your laptop in a regular canvas bag, but…  this thing?  Might actually survive.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah?  "Stout" is the word he uses.  Stout.  Like a…  a little tank.   And speaking of laptops, what about the…  the laptop sleeve?  Any good?</Person1>
<Person2>Eh…  it's there.  A little padding, but…  not much.  Definitely not as protective as a, you know… dedicated laptop bag.</Person2>
<Person1>Right, right.  So, uh…  gentle placement is still advised.   But hey, at least it fits a "smedium" camera cube!  With room to spare!</Person1>
<Person2>Oh yeah?  That's…  that's good to know.  For all the…  photographer types out there.   Although, three pounds…  plus camera gear…  that's…  that's a workout.</Person2>
<Person1>Totally!  But, um… back to this whole…  messenger bag resurgence.  Thirty percent of Freitag's sales?  And…  growing?  That's… surprising.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, a little.  I mean, I guess nostalgia is a powerful thing.  The nineties…  they're back, baby!  Platform shoes, chokers…  the whole shebang.</Person2>
<Person1>Seriously!    It's like a… a time warp.  But, hey, if messenger bags are… "excellent carryalls," as he says…  then maybe it's a good thing?  Practical and trendy.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, I can dig it.  As long as I don't have to…  listen to all that velcro.</Person2>
<Person1>Okay, so, this weight issue.  Three point two six pounds.  That's… that's getting up there for a messenger bag, isn't it?</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, it's… dense.  Like a small bowling ball.   But, hey, maybe that's the price you pay for durability?  Like, you know,  it's built to last.</Person2>
<Person1>Right, right.  He mentions it loosening up with use.  So, maybe it's just… initially stiff?  Like breaking in a new pair of shoes.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, I get that.  My… uh… my old Freitag, it's like… buttery soft now.  Took years, but… worth it.</Person2>
<Person1>So, this PET bottle fabric… tough, but rigid.  Hmm. How's it compare to, like, regular messenger bag material?</Person1>
<Person2>Way sturdier.  More… protective.  Like, you wouldn't want to drop your laptop in a regular canvas bag, but… this thing? Might actually survive.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah?  "Stout" is the word he uses.  Stout.  Like a little tank.   And speaking of laptops, what about the laptop sleeve?  Any good?</Person1>
<Person2>Eh… it's there.  A little padding, not much. Definitely not as protective as a, you know… dedicated laptop bag.</Person2>
<Person1>Right, right. So, gentle placement is still advised.  But hey, at least it fits a "smedium" camera cube.  With room to spare!</Person1>
<Person2>Oh yeah? That's good to know. For all the… photographer types out there.  Although, three pounds… plus camera gear… that's a workout.</Person2>
<Person1>Totally! But, um… back to this messenger bag resurgence. Thirty percent of Freitag's sales? And… growing?  That's surprising.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, a little.  I guess nostalgia is a powerful thing. The nineties… they're back, baby! Platform shoes, chokers… the whole shebang.</Person2>
<Person1>Seriously!  It's like a time warp. But, hey, if messenger bags are… "excellent carryalls," as he says… then maybe it's a good thing? Practical and trendy.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, I can dig it. As long as I don't have to… listen to all that velcro.</Person2>
<Person1>So, uh…  lots of interesting reviews here.  Instant cameras, AI glasses, robot vacuums… even lasers powering smart homes.  It's a lot to unpack.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah!  It's like a… a whirlwind of tech.    That robot vacuum with the arm, though.  Sounds… intense.</Person2>
<Person1>Right?  And the dog… not a fan, apparently.   Poor pup. But, uh… AI smart glasses?  Google's prototypes? I'm… intrigued.</Person1>
<Person2>Me too!  I mean, we've seen this before, right?  But… Google?  They… they could actually pull it off. Maybe.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, maybe.  Though, remember Google Glass?  That didn't exactly… take off.    Fashion faux pas, perhaps?</Person1>
<Person2>Totally!  But these new ones…  they sound… different. More… integrated?  Less… clunky?</Person2>
<Person1>Perhaps.  We'll see.  But, um… lasers powering smart homes?  That's… new.  And… potentially terrifying.</Person1>
<Person2>Right?  Like something out of a… a sci-fi movie.  Pew pew!    But, hey, if it works…</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, if it works.  Though, I'd… I'd want to see some serious safety testing first.  Don't want my house turning into a… a laser light show.</Person1>
<Person2>Totally.  Safety first! But, uh… that Huawei trifold phone?  Great phone, shouldn't buy?  That's… a contradiction.</Person2>
<Person1>Right?  Sounds like there's a… a story there.  Something… juicy.</Person1>
<Person2>Definitely.  And, uh… two GPS hiking apps for backpacking?  I mean…  why two?  Isn't one… sufficient?</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, you'd think.  But apparently…  not always.  Redundancy, I guess?  Just in case?</Person1>
<Person2>Makes sense.  Especially if you're… you know…  out in the wilderness.  No cell service, and all that.</Person2>
<Person1>Exactly!  Safety first!  But, um… back to those instant cameras.  They're… they're having a moment, aren't they?</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah!  It's like…  analog is back.  Vinyl records, film photography…  instant cameras.  It's a whole…  retro revival.</Person2>
<Person1>Totally.  Nostalgia is a powerful thing. But, uh…  Jony Ive and Sam Altman building something?  That's… big.  What could it be?</Person1>
<Person2>Right?  That's…  that's the million-dollar question.  Literally.   And, uh… Mission Impossible as a comedy?  I'm…  I'm not sure how I feel about that.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, it's…  an interesting take.  A bold choice.  We'll see how it plays out.  But, um… Nvidia's RTX 5060 review debacle?  Sounds…  messy.</Person1>
<Person2>Definitely.  A wake-up call for…  everyone, apparently.  Gamers, reviewers…  the whole lot.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah.  And Microsoft building an AI "agent factory"?  That's…  ambitious.  And… potentially scary.    Depending on what kind of agents they're…  cooking up.</Person1>
<Person2>True.  And Trump's budget?  Pro-AI, pro-pollution, pro-surveillance?  That's…  a lot to process.   It's…  a lot.</Person2>
<Person1>It is.  And Google's confusing AI product names?  Yeah, that's…  definitely a thing.    They need a…  a naming consultant, perhaps?</Person1>
<Person2>Seriously!  It's like…  alphabet soup.  But hey, that's all the time we have for today, folks!  Thanks for tuning in to XTrends!  We'll catch you next time!</Person2>
<Person1>And from me, a big thank you and goodbye!  Stay trendy!</Person1>
