<Person1> "Welcome to Rela A-I!  R-E-L-A, A-I! Your daily dose of trending news. Today, we're hitting the road, virtually of course, to jolly old England! Can Americans drive there with a US license? Buckle up, buttercup, because we're about to find out!"
</Person1><Person2> "Hold on, hold on!  Before we veer onto the wrong side of the road, metaphorically speaking, I have a burning question. Do I need to learn to drive a stick shift? Because, you know, those British cars are fancy!" 
</Person2><Person1> "Not necessarily! This article from, um, July 15, 2025, says a valid US driver's license is your golden ticket for a whole year!  No need for a British license. Amazing, right? You can rent a car and zip around London or take a scenic road trip through the Cotswolds. Just, uh, remember which side of the road to drive on! " 
</Person1><Person2> "Wait, a whole year? So I could, like, move there for a year and just drive around with my good ol' American license?  Road trip!" 
</Person2><Person1> "Well, technically, yes, as long as you entered England after July 15th, 2025.   The article specifies 12 months from your entry date. But, uh, there's a catch! You can only drive small vehicles, like cars and motorcycles. No double-decker buses for you!" 
</Person1><Person2> "Aw, man! There goes my dream of being a London bus driver.  But okay, a sporty little convertible through the English countryside sounds pretty good too. What about renting? Any special rules?"
</Person2><Person1> "Just the usual.   Valid, non-expired license, passport, proof of return travel, and a valid address in England.  If your license isn't in English, you'll need an international driving permit. Oh, and if you're thinking of shipping your own car over..."
</Person1><Person2> "Whoa, hold up!  Ship my car?  Is that even a thing?"
</Person2><Person1> "Apparently!   You can drive your own car for up to six months, either in one go or split over multiple visits within a year.  No need to register it or change the plates. Just make sure you have insurance that covers you in England. And keep your plane ticket handy in case the police stop you." 
</Person1><Person2> "Imagine explaining to a British bobby that you shipped your car across the Atlantic!  That's a conversation starter!"
</Person2><Person1> "Ha!  Totally. So, there you have it folks.  Driving in England with a US license? Totally doable! Thanks for tuning in to Rela A-I!  We'll catch you next time with more exciting news!"</Person1>
